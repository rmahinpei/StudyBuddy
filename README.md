# StudyBuddy
*Taking time management to the next level*

## Description

With the immense workload of university students, effective studying and time management become essential 
to success. This is why I built **StudyBuddy**, an interactive app allowing university students 
to track club dates, course dates, and the practice questions they complete for their courses. 

For many university courses, independent practice is essential to performing well in exams. 
To ensure academic success, the main feature of **StudyBuddy** allows its users to create topics for 
each of their courses and assign a *minimum* of three relevant practice questions to each topic. 
The aim of this feature is to encourage students to identify exam-worthy subjects and then 
do a minimum of three practice problems per each topic so that they can master what they are taught in lectures.
With this set-up, **StudyBuddy** will help students manage their time more effectively, make their 
learning more efficient, and hopefully reduce their exam-related stress.
